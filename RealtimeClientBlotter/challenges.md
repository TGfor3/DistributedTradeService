# Distributed System Challenges and Solutions

## 1. Fault Detection and Recovery

**Challenges:**
- In distributed systems, transient or permanent failures of nodes can significantly impact service availability and data integrity.
- The distributed nature of the server components increases the complexity of detecting and recovering from failures.

**Approach:**
- **Hazelcast Integration:** Use Hazelcast to monitor all service nodes and their availability, enhancing the system's ability to detect and manage node status dynamically. Utilize Hazelcastâ€™s event listeners to keep track of available nodes, ensuring the system remains robust against node failures
- **Dynamic Gateway Rerouting:** Enhance the Gateway to dynamically detect node failures and reroute the client to the appropriate blotter service node, minimizing disruption to data flow and maintaining consistent service delivery.

## 2. Autoscaling

**Challenges:**
- Dynamic traffic patterns necessitate the system to efficiently scale resources, especially critical with Kafka and server-sent events experiencing high data flows.
- Ensuring that scaling operations are cost-effective and avoid resource underutilization or over-provisioning.

**Approach:**
- **Stateless Architecture:** Design the system to be inherently stateless, facilitating easier and more flexible horizontal scaling, allowing for the addition or removal of resources without complex state management overhead.

## 3. Load Balancing

**Challenges:**
- Effectively distributing client requests and data streams across multiple nodes to prevent any single point of bottleneck.
- Managing the distribution of messages within the Client Data Routing Service (CDRS) to ensure even workload distribution and optimal system performance.

**Approach:**
- **CDRS Deployment:**  Deploy CDRS nodes to filter and route Kafka messages appropriately, ensuring even distribution across application servers. This helps in balancing the workload and enhancing overall system performance
- **Intelligent Routing Mechanisms:** Implement and continually refine intelligent routing mechanisms in CDRS, adjusting load distribution based on real-time assessments of node capacities and response times.

## 4. Real-Time Updates

**Challenges:**
- Ensuring that real-time updates via server-sent events are delivered promptly and reliably, without significant delays.
- Managing the connection and data transmission overhead involved with maintaining persistent connections for real-time updates

**Approach:**
- **Optimized Real-Time Data Flow:** Focus on streamlining the data flow through efficient management of server-sent events, ensuring real-time updates are delivered efficiently.
